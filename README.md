The aim of this study was to investigate child health-care coordinators' experiences of being a facilitator for the implementation of a new national child health-care programme in the form of a web-based national guide.
The study was based on eight remote, online focus groups, using Skype for Business. A qualitative content analysis was performed.
The analysis generated three categories: adapt to a local context, transition challenges and led by strong incentives. 
There were eight subcategories. In the latent analysis, the theme 'Being a facilitator: a complex role' was formed to express the child health-care coordinators' experiences.
Facilitating a national guideline or decision support in a local context is a complex task that requires an advocating and mediating role. 
For successful implementation, guidelines and decision support, such as a web-based guide and the new child health-care programme, must match professional consensus and needs and be seen as relevant by all. 
Participation in the development and a strong bottom-up approach was important, making the web-based guide and the programme relevant to whom it is intended to serve, and for successful implementation. 
The study contributes valuable knowledge when planning to implement a national web-based decision support and policy programme in a local health-care context.
